# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is the result of working through the very basic steps of creating a website.  The process was instrumental in being prepared for class by learning the basics of html, css, JavaScript and Git.  The process included using workflow tools and best practices with the terminal command line, VSCode and GitHub.


## Installation

## Usage

This website can be used to assess the student's progress and preparedness for class.  While it looks like it could be used to read and share prework notes on the subjects, it is purely perfunctory and not a full list of all that was learned.  

## Credits

Bootcamp prework study lessons and videos were very helpful.  And several random tech websites were helpful when I searched for help online.  The Github website was helpful.  Special thanks to stack overflow.

## Features
